# Script Descriptions
* The script titled as __"FFT_and_InducedVoltageCalculations"__ is the main script for calculating the induced voltages with selected harmonic components.
Throughout the script, flux per pole with respect to angle is also calculated. 

* The script titled as __"FluxPerPoleCalculations"__ is calculating the maximum value of the flux per pole from the flux values from different surfaces.

* Other scripts are different functions utilized in the main scripts. __"fftCalculator"__ function returns the values of the magnitudes and angles of 
different harmonics. Then these values are used in __"inducedVoltageCalculator"__ function to calculate the induced voltage with selected harmonic content.
The data is imported via __"importfile"__ function
